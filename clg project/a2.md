## Part A


### Q1:  Answer the following questions based on the chart in the article [Cost of Branching](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/branching/) (5 marks):

#### What is measured on the y-axis?
The number of cycles per iteration is measured on the y-axis.

#### What value is represented along the x-axis?
The branch probablity (P) is represented along the x-axis.


#### Approximately how many CPU cycles does it take if there is a 20% chance that the branch will be taken?
Approximately 6 cycles.

#### Approximately how many CPU cycles does it take if there is an 80% chance that the branch will be taken?
Approximately 7 cycles.

#### At approximately what probability that a branch is taken does it take the most CPU cycles
The CPU cycles peak at 50-55% branch probablity which is approximately 14 cycles per iteration.

### Q2: In the article [Cost of Branching](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/branching/), why does the right side of the chart not reflect the left side (In other words why does the chart not look like a single hill)? (1 mark)
It takes just ~1 cycle to only check conditions that are never satisfied (P = 0), and ~7 cycles for the sum if the branch is always taken (P = 100), so after a calculation till 50-55 almost all the  conditions are checked atleast once which makes the CPU further assume the steps further and then increases the performance and reduces the cycles per iteration and thus the graph reaches it's minima and is on a constant decrease after probablity of 55, whereas from 0-55 it's probablity is on a constant increase.

### Q3: Explain what is meant by the term **Pipelining**. (1 mark)
In simple words, Pipelining is a process in which a computer performs predefined successive steps and concurrently starts preparing for the second step before the first step is complete so that it remains ready and no time is wasted. 

### Q4: What is a **Control Hazard**? (1 mark)
In the process of pipelining, to hide the latency, the computer/CPU may counter some possible hazards, one of which is a Control Hazard,a Control Hazard is a hazard in which the CPU is unable to tell which instructions does it need to execute next. Incorrect branch prediction and decisions results in Control Hazard. It is also known as branch hazard.

### Q5:If the CPU wrongly predicts which branch is taken, what happens? (1 mark)
If the CPU wrongly predicts the next branch then the pipeline then needs to execute the branch completely from the beginning in the next cycle. Generally everything is flused, the entire pipeline gets flushed and needs to be started over. I approximately wastes 15-20 cycles. The branches are either to be removed completely or made predictable so that the CPU can effectively speculate on what is to be executed next.


### Q6: The article [Cost of Branching](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/branching/) states that when a CPU encounters a jump, it will speculatively execute the branch that seems more likey.  Explain what this means in your own words (3 mark)
During execution of any of the process, the CPU computes statistics about branches taken on each instruction and starts to learn about it, then after executing the same process for several times the computer then starts predicting how the resulting patterns and flow of the program would be. If to be taken an example of any condition that has 50-50 probablity, after one of the condition goes wrong then the CPU basically memorizes or makes up to what the condition and execution was because of which if the CPU has to face the same result or faces the same conditions again then the probablity of the results being in the same way and the probablity of that path increases which in turn reduces the number of cycles subsequently reducing the cost of braching. When combined with good branch prediction, speculative execution increases performance by a lot.

### Q7: Sorting the array will change the performance even though the number of times the branch is taken remains the same.  Explain why (1 mark)
Talking about an unsorted array, the performance becomes a bit low as the number of branches though be the same but any array needs to be sorted in order to get the equation done, whereas in case of a sorted array, the sorted array here saves a lot of step in terms of sorting it, which basically increases the speed of functioning and thus results in a better performance.A branch prediction determines whether a conditional branch in the flow is to be considered or not, the same branch needs not to be executed again and again during the sorting which further control hazards in which the whole array needs to be now executed from the beginning. 

### Q8: In the article, [Cost of Branching](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/branching/), the second code block contains the variable **s**.  This variable is preceded with the keyword **volatile**, why? (1 mark)
The volatile keyword here is used so as to mark the keyword 's' as it canb be changes at any time without any action been taken by the code. The accumulator here is marked as volatile so that the compiler does not make it's value as a vector in the loop. Volatile is used when the compiler generates a code to make it go through a variable each and every single time it is given a command by the source code.

## Part C



### Q1: Does your graph have a similar shape to that found in the article? If it did not, what was the difference?
Our graph is basically of a similar shape to the graph given to the one in the article but it just has slight differences, the differences are due to the different models and different operating CPUs which might create a difference in the timings and thus creates a different graph. The highest time is taken around P 50-60 in the article and even in the graph uploaded by us whereas in the end the P works with least time and yeilds it's best performance. The basic difference is due to different operating systems and the similarity is due to the fact that after 50, the probablity is mostly known to the CPU and the CPU then starts to predict how and which path it should take to execute the iteration to completion.


### Q2: After learning about the cost of branching, what changes if any does it have on how you might approach a programming problem?
After learning about the cost of branching, branching allows the coder to collaborate inside of a single central code base. The coder creates a branch, the CPU starts memorizing the equations the same way as the programmer does and lets the coder know  about importance of a sorted array. One problem at a time and sorting is what I have learnt by knowing about the cost of branching.

### Q3: What was the most interesting thing you learned about in this assignment?
The most intresting learning about the assignment was how after a certain number of wrong trials, the program then starts executing and producing answers and giving out the results  with a much lower time and with a greater efficiency. Also we found that solving of the a2.cpp file and implementing the logic of running loops so it can generate 505 values from numbers 0 to 100, as another interesting part of this assignment.
